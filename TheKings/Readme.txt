You need to fetch the data, convert it into a local representation (you could use Json.NET) and
answer the following questions (you could use LINQ):
1. How many monarchs are there in the list?
2. Which monarch ruled the longest (and for how long)?
3. Which house ruled the longest (and for how long)?
4. What was the most common first name?
